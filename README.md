# Customer-Interaction-Analysis--Excel

Project Objective: The Customer Contact Analysis project aims to extract valuable insights from a dataset of customer interactions. Its primary focus is on understanding the nature of these interactions, evaluating agent performance, and gauging customer feedback to enhance overall customer service and experience.

## Dataset Overview: 
The dataset encompasses the following columns:

S.No: A unique serial number for each entry.

Customer ID: A distinct identifier for each customer.

Order ID: A unique order identifier.

Customer Name: The name of the customer.

Contact Date: The date when the customer was contacted.

Contact Type: The purpose of the contact (e.g., Query, Request, Complaint).

Is It for an Order?: Indicates whether the contact is related to an order (Yes/No).

Ticket ID: Identifier for the customer service ticket.

Agent Handled: Name of the agent who managed the customer contact.

Rating Given: The customer's rating, expressed as a percentage.

Main Goals: The key objectives of the Customer Contact Analysis project are as follows:

Contact Type Analysis: Investigate the distribution of contact types to identify the primary reasons for customer support inquiries.

Agent Performance: Assess agent performance based on their handling of customer interactions and customer ratings.

Order-Related Contacts: Examine the proportion of contacts related to orders and identify recurring issues.

Customer Feedback: Analyze customer ratings and feedback to gauge overall satisfaction.

## Data Handling Steps: 
To accomplish these goals, the following data processing steps are essential:

**1. Data Import**: Import the dataset into Microsoft Excel.

**2. Data Cleaning**: Clean the data by addressing missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.

**3.Data Transformation**: Create calculated columns if necessary, such as converting the "Rating Given" column to a numerical format.

**4.Data Analysis**: Utilize Excel's functions and tools to perform data analysis. For instance, employ pivot tables to scrutinize contact types, agent performance, and order-related contacts.

**5.Data Visualization**: Create charts, graphs, and tables to visually represent the findings and insights. For example, use bar charts to depict the distribution of contact types and agent performance.


## Key Insights: 
Based on the analysis, the project has yielded the following key insights:

**Contact Type Analysis**: Requests were the most common contact type, accounting for 53% of customer interactions, followed by Queries (38%) and Complaints (9%). This indicates that a significant portion of customer contacts is related to specific requests, highlighting the need for attention and potential improvement in this area.

**Customer Visits**: The data indicates that daily customer visits remained consistent with no unusual fluctuations, suggesting that there are no significant variations in the frequency of customer contacts over the analyzed period.

**Agent Roch Cousineau:** Roch Cousineau had the highest number of customer interactions among all agents. This suggests that Roch plays a pivotal role in customer service and may warrant further analysis to understand the reasons behind the high interaction volume and to potentially optimize workload distribution among agents.
